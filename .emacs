;; Visual Executables

         (getenv "PATH")))

;; Pager Setup

;;    If any program wants to pause the output through the =$PAGER=
;;    variable, well, we don't really need that:

;; Aliases

;;    Gotta have some [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EshellAlias][shell aliases]], right?

(defalias 'e 'find-file)

;; Replacing the window with the new buffer may not be what I want.

(defalias 'ee 'find-file-other-window)

;; Some of my favorite bash aliases, can be even more helpful in
;;    Eshell.

;;    However, my =gst= command should be an alias to =magit-status=, but
;;    using the =alias= doesn't pull in the current working directory, so
;;    I make it a function, instead:

(defun eshell/gst (&rest args)
    (magit-status (pop args) nil))

(defun eshell/l (&rest args)
    (dired (pop args) nil))
